# Etch-A-Sketch
In-browser Etch-A-Sketch of a sort

A project with The Odin Project

I went a bit beyond the assignment itself, adding buttons and a color selector, making the fade to black able to fade from any starting color, and having the palette remember color choices on reset.

This project gave me my first foray into CSS Grid. I also experimented with a CSS variable and played around with layout options. The UI is pretty simple, but this project was meant to focus on Javascript. Added buttons aside, I chose to go above and beyond elsewhere.

The Javascript side was the most challenging. I decided to work on making my code eminently readable and modular. I'm pretty happy with the results!

At first it was challenging to make functions for everything rather than relying on global variables. It became more natural as I went.

In all, I am proud of this project. I really enjoyed making decisions as to bits of functionality I wanted to add, and challenging myself to add them.
